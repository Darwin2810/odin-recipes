      Crispy chicken sushi rolls offer a delightful twist on traditional sushi,
      combining the crunchiness of fried chicken with the classic elements of
      sushi. These rolls typically feature crispy, breaded chicken strips
      alongside fresh vegetables like cucumber and avocado, all neatly rolled in
      seaweed and seasoned rice. The result is a satisfying blend of textures
      and flavors, marrying the savory crispiness of the chicken with the
      freshness of the vegetables. Perfect for those who enjoy a bit of crunch
      in their sushi, these rolls showcase the creativity and versatility that
      can be found in the world of Japanese-inspired cuisine.

    <ul>
      <li>6 toasted nori sheets</li>
      <li>
        1 quantity sushi rice (<a href="./rice-recipe.html"
          >click here for recipe</a
        >)
      </li>
      <li>6 oakleaf lettuce leaves, torn</li>
      <li>Soy sauce and wasabi, to serve</li>
      <li>280g chicken breast fillet</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (135g) kewpie mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for shallow frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          For the crispy chicken, slice the chicken in half horizontally to
          produce two thin breast fillet pieces, then slice each piece into 1cm
          wide long strips. Place chicken strips in a medium bowl and add
          kewpie, tossing to combine and evenly coat. Place panko in a separate
          medium bowl and season with salt flakes and ground white pepper.
          Working in small batches, coat the chicken strips in panko, pressing
          down firmly to adhere. Transfer to a baking paper lined baking tray in
          a single layer. Once all chicken is coated, transfer tray to fridge
          and chill, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes to set the crumb.

        <p style="width: 400px">
          Place enough oil in a large, deep frypan to reach a depth of 3cm.
          Place the pan over medium-high heat. Shallow fry the panko chicken in
          batches for 3-5 minutes each, turning occasionally, or until golden
          and cooked. Transfer to paper towel to drain and immediately season
          with salt flakes and ground white pepper. Set aside to cool to room
          temperature.
        </p>

          Place one nori sheet, shiny-side down, on a sushi mat. Using slightly
          damp hands, spread one-sixth of the rice mixture over the nori sheet,
          leaving a 3cm-wide border at top of sheet. Place lettuce along the
          edge facing you, then top with crispy chicken. Using the sushi mat,
          roll up firmly to enclose filling. Repeat with remaining nori, rice
          mixture, lettuce and crispy chicken.
        </p>
