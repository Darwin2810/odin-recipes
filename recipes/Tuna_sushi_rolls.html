          Place one nori sheet, shiny-side down, on a sushi mat. Using slightly
          damp hands, spread one-sixth of the rice mixture over the nori sheet,
          leaving a 3cm-wide border at top of sheet. Mix kewpie and tuna
          together in a medium bowl. Spoon one-sixth of the tuna mixture along
          the edge facing you, then top with cucumber. Using the sushi mat, roll
          up firmly to enclose filling. Repeat with remaining nori, rice
          mixture, tuna mixture and cucumber.
