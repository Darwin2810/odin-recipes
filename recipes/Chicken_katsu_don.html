      Chicken Katsu Don is a Japanese comfort dish featuring crispy,
      golden-brown chicken katsu served on a bed of steamed rice. Topped with a
      savory-sweet donburi sauce, softly cooked eggs, and sliced green onions,
      it offers a delicious blend of textures and flavors in a satisfying rice
      bowl.

      <li>Sunflower oil, to shallow fry</li>

        4 long green shallots, white part finely chopped, green part shredded

      <h5>CABBAGE SALAD</h5>
      <li>1 tbs sunflower oil</li>
      <li>2 tbs rice wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 wombok cabbage (about 325g), shredded</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Cook the sushi rice according to packet instructions. Set aside,
          covered, and keep warm until ready to serve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to create 4 thin
          pieces. Whisk 2 of the eggs in a medium bowl, and place flour and
          panko breadcrumbs in 2 separate bowls. Dust each piece of chicken in
          flour, dip in the whisked egg, then cover in breadcrumbs, pressing to
          coat the chicken completely. Place on a tray and chill for 10 minutes
          to firm.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Meanwhile, combine miso paste with 3/4 cup (180ml) of boiling water in
          a jug, stir, and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          For the cabbage salad, place sunflower oil, rice wine vinegar and
          sesame oil in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Add cabbage, toss to
          coat and set aside until ready to serve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Heat 2cm of sunflower oil in a large frypan over medium heat. Working
          in batches, fry chicken for 5-6 minutes, turning once, until golden.
          Drain on paper towel and season. Set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Add half the miso broth and half the whites of the long green shallot
          to a clean, large frypan and bring to a boil. Beat the remaining 2
          eggs together in a jug. Place two of the chicken pieces in the pan and
          carefully pour over half the beaten egg on and around chicken. Turn up
          the heat to medium-high, cover and cook for 3 minutes or until egg is
          just set. Using a wide fish slice, scoop up chicken katsu and some of
          the egg and remove from pan and chop each piece into 5 even slices.
          Repeat with remaining chicken, miso, shallot and egg.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 400px">
          Meanwhile, combine 1 tbs sunflower oil, rice wine vinegar and sesame
          oil in a small bowl. Season, then toss through cabbage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Divide warm rice among serving bowls and top with 5 slices of chicken
          and some cabbage. Scatter over shredded long green shallot, nori and
          sesame seeds, to serve.
