    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Place oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over high heat. Sear pork,
          turning, for 5-6 minutes until all sides are lightly golden and skin
          is slightly blistered.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Combine sake, soy, mirin, sugar, ginger and 4 cups (1L) water in a
          large jug. Pour over pork belly and bring to a simmer. Skim off any
          impurities that rise to the surface. Reduce heat to low, cover with a
          lid and simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes-1 hour 30 minutes, until pork is
          tender, but not falling apart. Remove from heat and cool to room
          temperature. Chill overnight to allow flavours to develop.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p style="width: 400px">
          Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil. Add eggs and
          cook for 6 1/2 minutes. Drain and refresh in iced water. Peel eggs and
          place in cooking liquid with the pork to marinate overnight.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          The following day, remove eggs and set aside. Place pan over medium
          heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 20-25 minutes until pork
          is warmed through. Remove pork from braising liquid and thinly slice.
          Place on a serving platter and pour over braising liquid. Top with
          halved eggs. To eat, place a slice of pork on a lettuce leaf and top
          with desired condiments and egg, and roll up to eat.
