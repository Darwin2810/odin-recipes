    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups (430g) sushi rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (125ml) rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tbs white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp fine salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water
          until water runs clear. Drain well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Transfer rice to a medium saucepan (see note) and add 3 cups (750ml)
          cold water. Place pan over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer,
          stirring the rice a few times. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cover
          pan. Cook, untouched, for 12 minutes. Turn heat off and leave rice,
          covered and untouched, for 15 minutes. Remove lid and use a fork to
          gently loosen the rice from pan. Tip rice out into a large heatproof
          glass bowl.
        </p>
      </li>

          Meanwhile while rice is cooking, for the sushi rice dressing, place
          all ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring
          constantly, until sugar dissolves and mixture comes to a simmer.
          Simmer, untouched, for 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and set aside
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="width: 400px">
          Slowly drizzle the warm dressing over the warm rice while using a
          paddle or spatula to cut through the rice to help separate the rice
          grains. Continue to cut through the rice until all the dressing has
          been absorbed, rice grains are separate, sticky and cooled down. Use
          or serve.
